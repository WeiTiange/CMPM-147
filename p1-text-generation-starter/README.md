## Title:
Explore Planets!

## Description:
This is an introduction of a new planet for the traveler who arrives on the planet for the first time. The generated texts introduce the features of the planet, such as the type of the planet, the location of it, and how long the traveler is able to stay on it. 

## Additional way of expansion:
In my text generator, the planet(destination[]) that the traveler arrives has a option of being described as "Unknown planet in $galaxy Area", which will pull a random galaxy name from galaxy[]. So the text generator pull from the destination[] filler, then the destination[] filler will then pull from the galaxy[] filler. 

##  Artist Statement:
#### What is the effect you're tring to achieve?
I want to create stories of space traveling, which the traveler travels around different types of planets in different galaxies.

#### Did I achieve that effect?
I think I did achieve the effect by giving some random information of the planet.
