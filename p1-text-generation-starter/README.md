#### <span style="color:rgb(135,206,250)">What is the effect you're tring to achieve?</span>
It's an introduction of a new planet for the traveler who arrives on the planet for the first time. The generated texts introduce the features of the planet, such as the type of the planet, the location of it, and how long the traveler is able to stay on it. 

####  <span style="color:rgb(135,206,250)">Did I achieve that effect?</span>
I think I did achieve the effect of making an introduction of a planet by giving some random information of the planet.
